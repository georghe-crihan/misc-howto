# Add images to existing PDF with Mac OS X Preview

Do as follows:

1. Open the image you want to paste in Preview.app
2. Select All (<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>-<kbd>A</kbd>)
3. Copy (<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>)
4. Paste (<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd>)

Now you have a copy of your image pasted above your old image. This is apparently
meaningless, but the new copy is not just an _image_, but an _object_.
Click on the new image (round blue corners appear, no marching ants)
Copy (<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>)
Paste on your PDF document. The image is an _object_, moveable and resizable. The original
PDF is still a PDF, editable and all.
